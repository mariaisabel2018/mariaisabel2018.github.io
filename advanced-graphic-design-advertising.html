        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>In Fall 2020 I took STC 202 Advanced Graphic Design for Advertising and designed projects ranging from drawing yourself on illustrator to a design project based on a tv series.</p>

        <h2>Self Portrait</h2>
        <p>For the self portrait, I had to select a selfie and add a filter to it on photoshop to see the different shades of the image and make it easier to see when drawing the image on illustrator. I then used different tools such as the pen tool to draw shapes and as a whole combine them to create an illustration of my selfie. I needed to be very detailed even in the eyelashes to get as close a look to the original photo as possible.</p>

        <h2>Iconic TV Series Design Project Posters</h2>
        <p>For the Iconic TV Series Posters Project we were given the task of creating a promotional poster for an iconic series or movie. I chose to do Friends. Two of the most iconic symbols of Friends is the frame on Monica's door and the lobster. After creating a moodboard and researching different design style I decided to do the geometric look for the iconic symbols. I used multiple triangle shapes to create the lobster and the frame artwork. Finally, the professor told us to add the series logo and info such as where it is streaming.</p>
