      <section id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493
          following Christopher COLUMBUS' second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial
          rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and African slave labor introduced,
          Puerto Rico was ceded to the US
          as a result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US citizenship in 1917.</P>

        <p>Popularly elected governors have served since 1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing
          for internal self-government. In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters chose not to alter
          the existing political status with the US, but the results of a 2012 vote left open the possibility of
          American statehood. Economic recession on the island has led to a net population loss since about 2005,
          as large numbers of residents moved to the US mainland. The trend has accelerated since 2010; in 2014,
          Puerto Rico experienced a net population loss to the mainland of 64,000, more than double the net loss
          of 26,000 in 2010.</p>

        <p>Hurricane Maria struck the island on 20 September 2017 causing catastrophic damage, including destruction
          of the electrical grid that had been cripled by Hurricane Irma just two weeks before. It was the worst storm
          to hit the island in eight decades, and damage is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars.</p>

            capital around Caguas; most of the interior, particularly in the western half of the island, is dominated by
            the Cordillera Central mountains, where population density is low.</p>
